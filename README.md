# Facial Expression Recognition (FER)

This work is one of a series of three distinct repositories that collectively constitute the coursework focused on Neural Networks for the Data Science & Information Technologies masters course: Îœ124 - Machine Learning at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) during the Fall 2022 semester. The two other repositories deal with:
- [Activation functions & gradient analysis](https://github.com/KyriakosPsa/ActFunc-GradientAnalysis)
- [Adversarial Neural Networks (ANN)](https://github.com/KyriakosPsa/Neural-Networks-Adversarial-Examples)

This specific repository performs facial-expression-recognition using a CNN architecture, trained on a dataset from [Kaggle's challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gauravsharma99/facial-emotion-recognition/data).

# Overview

This machine learning project was undertaken using Python and Keras, focusing on neural networks. The exercise explored network architectures and activation functions, and the capability to reproduce results was demonstrated.
